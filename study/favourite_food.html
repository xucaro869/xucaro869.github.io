        <li>
            Salt, sugar and 2 slices of ginger

    <h3><center>Directions:</center></h3>

    
    <ol>
        <li>
            Leave the beef tail chunks until they are thawed out.
        </li>
        <li>
            Boil them and remove the bubbles from the pot. Pour out all the water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Put the chunks into a high pressure cooker along with 2 slices of onion, add water, and cook for 30 mins. to 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cool it on the countertop, and then in the fridge or outside, if it has been snowing. Leave overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the top layer of white fat using a spoon. Put the rest into a pot.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slice tomatoes and put them into the pot and heat until the jello-like substance around the beef tail chunks melts.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add 2 tbsp. of sugar and boil until soup becomes red with 
            <b id="color">this color - TOMATOES.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            Add a pinch of salt to the mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add any other vegetables within 5 minutes of finishing your stew.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour it all into a big bowl and bring it to the dinner table.
        </li>
    </ol>
